## About

This repository is an extention (or adaptation) of the tesseract-main repository at https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

When I tried to take this original repo, install and run a fine tuning training, I ran into many problems of file missing and incorrent pointing to files.
After I fixed all the problems and finally succeeded to run a training - I desided to save & share the final repository, for helping others.

Hopefully it will help you :)

## Installing Tesseract

TODO: Fill that part !

A C++ compiler with good C++17 support is required for building Tesseract from source.

## Running Tesseract Training

TODO: Fill that part !
